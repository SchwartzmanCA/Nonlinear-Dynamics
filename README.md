# Nonlinear Dynamics Computational Work

This is the coding work that I needed to finish the assignments in the Santa Fe Institute's Nonlinear Dynamics Course (Spring 2023). This was largely me trying to brush off my Python, so a lot of the code---especially the earlier stuff---is sloppy. I added some markdown corresponding to the problems I was trying to solve, but it may not correspond perfectly.
