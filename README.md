# Nonlinear Dynamics Computational Work

This is the coding work that I needed to finish the assignments in the Santa Fe Institute's Nonlinear Dynamics Course (Spring 2023). This was largely me trying to brush off my Python, and I did not intend to publish this initially, so a lot of the code is rough work. Although, I did add some nice markdown with LaTeX corresponding to the problems I was trying to solve.
